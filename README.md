network  and web testing Tool
Project Overview:
This Tool is a comprehensive solution for web and network security assessments.with features to identify vulnerabilities, assess network services, and evaluate web applications.

Key Features

Port Scanning (Network): Conduct network reconnaissance using SYN, Ping, Vanilla, to identify open ports.

Web Application Assessment:

Directory Fuzzing: Probe web servers for hidden directories and files.
Technology Detection: Detect the technologies and frameworks used in web applications.
Content Management System (CMS) Identification: Determine the CMS running on web applications.
CMS Security Scanning: Scan CMS installations for vulnerabilities and weaknesses.

Service Identification: Identify network services and capture service banners for detailed analysis.

Network Protocol Bruteforcing: Perform credential bruteforcing on authentication protocols such as SSH, FTP, and more.

Web Application Credential Bruteforcing: Test the security of login forms by attempting to bruteforce credentials.

Vulnerability Detection (Network): Detect misconfigurations and vulnerabilities in discovered network services.

Web Parameter Discovery: Identify input parameters on web pages to assess potential attack surfaces.

Vulnerability Scanning (Web): Scan and validate vulnerabilities within web applications to ensure robust security.
